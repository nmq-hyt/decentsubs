A command line tool to interact with your youtube channel's subscriptions.


Purpose:
Over quarantine, in between gouts of stress, I realised I was spending too much time endlesslly scrolling through social media, or indeed youtube, and I wasn't
getting enough of what I wanted to do done. This happened to include programming, since I'm now a Comp Sci student, and even though I scored fairly well in my
first year tests, I still felt I could do more.

Thus, this came to mind.

My original idea was that rather than having me have to open youtube.com every day to see if something I wanted to watch was up, I would just type in something to my
command line, which would ping google's api services and return me a list of new videos from  a subset of my subscriptions that I actually wanted to see.

While this project is not finished, it has been very fruitful`for me, getting me to learn a great deal more about Python, and some of formal theory involved
in parsing, as well as more experience with Git.

If you  happen to have any critiques, please let me know.
